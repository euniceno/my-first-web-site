        <p>Like everybody else, I always think Eunice is 
            so cute. I'm sure her mbti is CUTE. Oh, and i 
            got this pic while I eating in the donut cafe.
            I got this pic with her permission. So don't 
            write rumors. <strong>Just enjoy her Cuteness! 
            </strong></p>
        <h3>Cute point</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>wide open mouse to eat donut</li>
            <li>happy face</li>
            <li>donut size is same as her face</li>
            <li>a mask hanging over her ear</li>
            <li>curl hair which makes her looks like cozy</li>
            <li>Pink peach makeup as if fruit juice is spilling out</li>
            +oc there's more than I found. Every part of her is 
                CUTE!
